# The use for this app?
 This web app will pull Nasa's photo of the day from thier photo of the day API.

 # Basic use
  On load you will have access to the current day's photo. 

  Once the image is loaded in you can like the picture adding
  it to an array in local storage that will save which photo's
  you enjoy. You can also unlike a picture that will remove it 
  from the local storage array.

  You can also use the search bar function. In order to use this 
  just type in the year, month, and day in this format YYYY-MM-DD

  In the navigation bar you can travel to the liked photos tab which
  will take you to your previsouly liked photos. Once there you will 
  see the photo, name of the photo, and the date it was taken. Under
  each photo will be a remove button to remove the photo from the liked
  list array.
